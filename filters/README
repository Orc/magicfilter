IMPORTANT: The only filters which have been tested are the deskjet,
ljet4m, ljet4ml, and cpsonly600 filters, since those are the only
printer types I have access to use.  Any additional files are untested,
even if they do not explicitly say so.  I would like information
if they work properly or not; please send me email at <orc@pell.chi.il.us>
if you are using any of the other sample filters.

Thanks,
