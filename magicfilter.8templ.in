MAN .SH DESCRIPTION
MAN .B &PROGRAM&
MAN is an extensible and customizable automatic printer filter.  It
MAN selects an appropriate conversion technique for the input data by
MAN seeking for
MAN .IR "magic numbers" ,
MAN and then utilizing the appropriate conversion utility.
MAN .PP
MAN .B &PROGRAM&
MAN is primarily intended for use as the ``input filter'' by the
MAN .B lpd
MAN print spooler.
LPR The options accepted by
LPR .B &PROGRAM&
LPR are exactly the ones passed to the input filter by
LPR .BR lpd .
LPR .SS OPTIONS
LPR Typically
LPR .B &PROGRAM&
LPR will be invoked by
LPR .B lpd
LPR and hence provided the right options automatically.  This list is
LPR included for reference only.
LPR .TP
LPR .I \-c
LPR Copy the input to the output without any conversion whatsoever (used
LPR by
LPR .B lpd
LPR whenever the
LPR .I \-l
LPR option is passed to the
LPR .B lpr
LPR program).
LPR .TP
LPR .I "\-nuser"
LPR The login name of the user who submitted the job.  Available to
LPR subfilters as
LPR .BR $LPUSER .
LPR If the user has an associated GECOS entry it will be available as
LPR .BR $LPUSERNAME .
LPR .TP
LPR .I "\-hhost"
LPR The host on which the job was submitted.  Available to subfilters as
LPR .BR $LPHOST .
LPR .TP
LPR .I "\-iindent"
LPR A numeric option passed by
LPR .BR lpd ;
LPR can be set by the user by the
LPR .I \-i
LPR option to
LPR .BR lpr.
LPR Although nominally used for the amount of indentation requested,
LPR .B &PROGRAM&
LPR makes it available to subfilters for any useful purpose as
LPR .BR $LPINDENT .
LPR .TP
NGOP.I "\-Cclassname"
NGOPLPRng class (priority) name.  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $LPCLASS .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Fformat"
NGOPFormat letter (passed by LPRng only).  When used as input filter (if)
NGOPthis will be
NGOP.IR f ,
NGOPwhen used as other filter types it will be the option character
NGOPcorresponding to this filter.  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $LPFORMAT .  
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Jjobname"
NGOPThe name of the printer job (passed by LPRng only).  Available to
NGOPsubfilters as
NGOP.BR $LPJOB .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Kcopies"
NGOPCopy count (passed by LPRng only).  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $LPCOPIES .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Lbannername"
NGOPUser name from the banner page (passed by LPRng only).  Available to
NGOPsubfilters as
NGOP.BR $BANNERNAME .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Pprinter"
NGOPPrinter name (passed by LPRng only).  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $PRINTER .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Qqueuename"
NGOPSpool queue name (passed by LPRng only).  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $LPQUEUE .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Raccountinfo"
NGOPAccounting information (passed by LPRng only).  Available to
NGOPsubfilters as 
NGOP.BR $LPACCT .
NGOP.TP
NGOP.I "\-Zoptions"
NGOPLPRng ``Z-options''.  The LPRng
NGOP.B lpr
NGOPprogram supports a
NGOP.I \-Z
NGOPoption, which can be used to pass arbitrary information to the printer
NGOPfilters.  Available to subfilters as
NGOP.BR $ZOPT .
LPR .TP
LPR .I \-\-debug
LPR Write debugging output to stdout.  Every \-\-debug increases the
LPR quantity of debugging output.
MAN .TP
MAN .I \-\-version
MAN Tell what version of
MAN .B magicfilter
MAN this is.
TRAD.TP
TRAD.I \-\-dump
TRADWrite the default magicfilter configuration to stdout.  This can be
TRADcustomised and put in @confdir@/magicfilter.cf if you wish to modify
TRADwhich filetypes magicfilter knows about.
LPR .TP
LPR .I \-\-help
LPR Prints out a synopsis of the command-line switches supported.
LPR .TP
LPR .I "other options"
LPR Any other options, such as the
LPR .IR \-w ,
LPR .IR \-l ,
LPR .IR \-x ,
LPR and
LPR .I \-y 
LPR options typically passed by
LPR .B lpd
LPR are ignored.
MAN .SS USING LPD
MAN To run
MAN .B &PROGRAM&
MAN from
MAN .B lpd
MAN it should be entered as one of the filters in the
MAN .I /etc/printcap
MAN file.  Typically, it will be the input filter (if).  Since most
MAN version of
MAN .B lpd
MAN do not accept arguments entered as part of the filter name, typically
MAN the filter name entered into the
MAN .I /etc/printcap
MAN file will simply be the name of the configuration file, which is set
MAN executable and starts with the line:
MAN .PP
MAN .B #! @exedir@/&PROGRAM&
MAN .PP
MAN Most UNIX kernels will then be able to treat the configuration file
MAN itself as if it was the actual program.
MAN .PP
MAN For systems which do not support the ``#!-hack'', the filter set in
MAN the if entry should point to
MAN .B &PROGRAM&
MAN directly, and the accounting file (af) entry should point to the
MAN configuration file.  This, however, is a less general, and hence less
MAN desirable solution.
LPNG.PP
LPNGThis version of
LPNG.B &PROGRAM&
LPNGsupports the enhanced 
LPNG.B lpd
LPNGincluded with the
LPNG.B LPRng
LPNGpackage from
LPNG.IR dickory.sdsu.edu .
MAN .SH BUGS
MAN .B Magicfilter
MAN has been extensively modified for the 2.0 release, and has very little
MAN in common with the old 1.2 magicfilter.  The
MAN .I config-file
MAN format has changed pretty drastically, and old config files will
MAN .B not
MAN work anymore.
MAN .PP
MAN Currently, there is no protection against the
MAN .B pipe
MAN or
MAN .B fpipe
MAN facilities going into an infinite loop.
MAN .PP
LPNGSome versions of
LPNG.B LPRng
LPNGseem to be moderately paranoid about security, and won't run
LPNGfilters if they don't live in the filter directory
LPNG.RI ( /usr/libexec/filters
LPNGon
LPNG.BR "slackware linux 8.1" ,
LPNGfor example) -- if your copy of
LPNG.B magicfilter
LPNGmysteriously refuses to work, set
LPNG.BR \-\-filterdir and \-\-execdir
LPNGto the filters directory or a subdirectory of it.)
