			INSTALLING MAGICFILTER
			----------------------


* Run "configure.sh".  If you want to put the files in any other directory
  tree than /usr/local (i.e. /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man) then call
  it with the option --prefix=<directory-prefix>, for example:

	./configure.sh --prefix=/usr

  Configure.sh works something like Autoconf's configure scripts, and
  has the following options:

    --src=DIR		where the source lives (.)
    --prefix=DIR	where to install the final product (/usr/local)
    --execdir=DIR	where to put executables (prefix/bin)
    --mandir=DIR	where to put manpages (prefix/man)
    --confdir=DIR	where to put configuration information (/etc)

	If magicfilter uses a private magic file, it will be placed
	here, and if you hand-make your own magic.m4 file, magicfilter
	will look for it here as well.

    --filterdir=DIR	where to put printer filters ($prefix/sbin/printers)
    --with-path=PATH	look for conversion programs in PATH ($PATH)

	If configure can't find a conversion program, it will build
	magicfilter without support for that particular conversion.

	Normally, magicfilter uses your $PATH to (hopefully) get all
	the normal places for filters, but you may need to customize
	it if you're on a system that places filters in odd locations.

		NOTE: This used to be --path in previous versions
		of Magicfilter.

    --use-local-magic	install a private magic file

	Normally, magicfilter will attempt to use /etc/magic (or
	whereever the magic for file(1) lives), but if that magic
	file does not appear to be modern enough (experimentally
	determined by seeing if it recognises a H-P pjl file),
	configure.sh will configure magicfilter to use a local
	magic file.   But there are cases where file(1) has been
	modified so that it doesn't just use /etc/magic, but instead
	has its magic files scattered randomly around, and thus
	configure.sh will report that /etc/magic works when it
	doesn't.  If you use --use-local-magic, magicfilter won't
	even bother to try and use the system /etc/magic.

    --with-papersize=size 

	Magicfilter writes US Letter size pages by default, but
	you can set the default to something else with this
	option.

    --traditional

	The normal magicfilter printer definition files are m4
	scripts that are merged with a standard ruleset.  If is is
	not how you want magicfilter to work, --traditional builds
	printer definition files that are already processed and
	installs a version of magicfilter that understands this
	format.   This is here for people who prefer to hack their
	printer definitions;  if you don't, installing the normal
	magicfilter makes all of your printers consistant.

* Run "make".

* Run "make install".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions apply only to systems using the BSD
printing system.  Linux and BSD-derived OSes all use the BSD printing
system, some System V-based systems such as IRIX do as an option
whereas others, such as Solaris, do not.

If in doubt, check for the existence of the file /etc/printcap.

NOTE: The traditional BSD print daemon does *not* support filters for
remote printers, hence the instructions below apply only to systems
which have the printers physically attached.  A version of lpd which
does not have this problem is available as a part of the LPRng package
from ftp://dickory.sdsu.edu/pub/LPRng/.  To use filters with remote
printers for LPRng, specify the "bqfilter" flag in /etc/printcap, for
example:

  # Remote HP LaserJet 4 (possibly connected via built-in Ethernet)
  remoteprinter:\
	:lp=:rm=printserver:rp=remoteprinter:\
	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/remoteprinter:\
	:bqfilter:mx#0:\
	if=/usr/sbin/printers/ljet4:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Edit your /etc/printcap file to contain a call to the appropriate
  printer filter in the "if" entry of each local printer.  This will
  typically look something like this:

  pencil|lp|PostScript|ljet4|HP LaserJet 4:\
	:lp=/dev/lp1:sd=/var/spool/lpd/pencil:sh:mx#0:\
	:if=/usr/sbin/printers/ljet4:

  crayon|dj550c|color|HP DeskJet 550C:\
	:lp=/dev/lp2:sd=/var/spool/lpd/crayon:sh:mx#0:\
	:if=/usr/sbin/printers/dj550c:

  Note the alias "lp" for the default (text) printer, and "PostScript"
  for the preferred PostScript printer.

  IMPORTANT: If you're on a really old version of UNIX which doesn't
  support the so-called "#!-hack" for selecting an interpreter for
  your filters, this form of installation does not work.  Instead, you
  need to make your /etc/printcap file look something like this:

  pencil|lp|PostScript|ljet4|HP LaserJet 4:\
	:lp=/dev/lp1:sd=/var/spool/lpd/pencil:sh:mx#0:\
	:if=/usr/local/bin/magicfilter:\
	:af=/usr/sbin/printers/ljet4:

  To test if your OS supports the #!-hack, type at the command line:

	/usr/local/bin/XXXX < /dev/null

  ... where XXXX-filter is any installed magic filter.  If you get an
  error message, your OS does *not* support the #!-hack.

  Linux, all BSD-derived OSes and System V R3 and later all support
  the #!-hack.

* Kill and restart lpd.  Your printer filter should now be working.
